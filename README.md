# Ahmer Alam Personal Website

Welcome to my personal project website! ðŸš€

## The website is deployed and can be accessed at [https://ahmeralam.co.uk](https://ahmeralam.co.uk).

The purpose of this project is to showcase my passion for learning new frameworks and coding languages, specifically focusing on my first dive into React and TypeScript. As of August 2024, the website serves as a portfolio, displaying information about the various projects I've completed, as well as the experiences I've encountered so far in life.
